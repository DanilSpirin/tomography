# Description

High-orbital satellite radiotomography of ionosphere with a heterogeneous stations network. Reconstructs electron density distribution from the GPS data, assuming single layer model. Uses multiscale approach: several consecutive grids of increased density. Uses either ART or SIRT method for solving a highly sparse SLE.
